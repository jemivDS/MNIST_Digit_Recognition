# MNIST_Digit_Recognition
Recognizing digits from MNIST set using a Convolutional Neural Network

This project is in-line with [The following Kaggle Data Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview)

Future Objectives to Improve Model Accuracy:
1. Tune Hyperparameters 
2. Increase # of Epochs
